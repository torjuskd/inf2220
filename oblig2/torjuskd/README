1.  How to compile your program (ie.  javac *.java)
    >javac *.java

2.  Which file includes the main-method
    Oblig2.java, to run:
    >java Oblig2 <projectName>.txt
    or use:
    >java Oblig2 <projectName>.txt manpower

3.  Any assumptions you have made when implementing the assignment

4.  Any peculiarities about your implementation
    In method "topSortPrint()", used to print the project info,
    the implementation is based on incrementing a variable "time",
    and counting how long time the project requires. This makes the
    calculation take longer than what could have been achiveved through
    other means.

5.  The status of your delivery (what works and what does not)
    The optional part of the assignment is not implemented.
    Everything else works.

6.  Give credit if your code is heavily infuenced by some source (ie.  teaching material).
