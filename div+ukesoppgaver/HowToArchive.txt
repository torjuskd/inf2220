How to create an archive File
.tar

You should create a tar'ed or zipped archive where the top-level directory is your
username.
If your username is 'myusername ' and you want to tar it:

> mkdir myusername 
> mv YourProgram.java utskrift.txt README.txt myusername/ 
> tar -czf myusername.tgz myusername/

This will give you a file called myusername.tgz which holds all the content of the assignment in a zipped (compressed) tar-file.
